# Patch Name
# ----------
# Generated size pack zips will use the patch name in the filename.
patchName = "MyTexturePack"

# Initial size
# ------------
# The initial resolution of the source designs. E.g. for a set of source designs that are 128x128px, set this to 128.
initialSize = 512

# Resize levels
# -------------
# The number of times to resize the texture pack, inclusive of the initial size.
# For example, specifying 3 resize levels for an initial size of 128x would generate 128x, 64x and 32x packs.
resizeLevels = 5

# Junk file types
# ---------------
# Ignore any of these file types, excluding them from the generated size packs.
junkFiletypes = [
  "**/*.{ai,psb,psd}",
  "**/*.{DS_Store,db}",
]

# Resizeables
# -----------
# Images to apply resizing to. By default, this is set up to exclude GUIs.
resizeables = [
  "**/*.png",
  "!**/{gui,guis}/**/*.png",
]

# Thresholdables
# --------------
# Image path patterns to apply alpha thresholding to - or in other words, remove any transparency from
# textures by forcing pixels' opacity to either 100% or 0. This is particularly useful for items, which
# arguably look best with hard edges.
#
# By default only items are thresholded, to prevent unintended side effects to other textures that often need to be translucent, like
# fluids.
#
# To customise thresholding, add more patterns to this array. Some examples:
#
# Example 1. Only threshold specific images:
# thresholdables: [
#   '**/item/**/*.png',
#   '**/some-texture.png',
# ],
#
# Example 2. Threshold everything, but exclude specific images:
# thresholdables: [
#   '**/*.png',
#   '!**/some-texture.png',
#   '!**/some-directory/**/*.png',
# ],
#
# Example 3. Disable thresholding altogether:
# thresholdables: [],
thresholdables = [
  "**/*item*/**/*.png",
]

# Compressables
# -------------
# Images to pass through lossless image compression. If you have issues with specific images as a result of
# compression, then add them to this list.
compressables = [
  '**/*.png',
]
